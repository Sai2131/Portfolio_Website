          I'm a senior at UCSC from Santa Clara, CA. I'm passionate about computer science, with particular interests in 
          backend development, distributed systems, operating systems, compilers, and computer architecture. Some of my projects are
          showcased below.
          I also enjoy staying active through working out and spending some free time with video games. 
          Some of my favorites include Rust, Overwatch, Minecraft, and 7D2D.
